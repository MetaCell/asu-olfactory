*Installation*

Start the proxy server first to avoid CORS blocking from localhost

```
cd ..\api-call-example-server
npm install express
node app.js
```

This will get the server proxy running on localhost:3010
Now build and start the actual client which uses the proxy server

```
cd ..\api-call-example-client
npm install
npm run build 
npm start
```
